# Cloud Security: The Shared Responsibility Model - Know Your Role! ☁️🔐

The shared responsibility model is nearly identical across the service provider landscape, and to break it down as simply as possible there are two distinct cloud security roles and responsibilities:

1. **Security “OF” the Cloud (CSPs)**
2. **Security “IN” the Cloud (Your Company)**

**Know Your Role!**

Whether you have adopted a multi-cloud strategy or a single-vendor solution, the customer responsibilities for security will include but may not be limited to these roles:

- 🔸 **Customer Data (Storage, Security & Protection)**
- 🔸 **Identity Management & Access Control**
- 🔸 **Platform, Application & OS Level Security**
- 🔸 **Network Traffic Routing & Management**
- 🔸 **Network Traffic Protection (Private Connectivity, Encryption, Integrity, Identity)**
- 🔸 **Network & Firewall Configuration (Cloud, Hybrid & On-prem)**
- 🔸 **Client-Side Security (Data Encryption, Integrity & Authentication)**
- 🔸 **Server-Side Security (Encryption — Filesystem And/Or Data)**
- 🔸 **Network Traffic Protection (Private Connectivity, Encryption, Integrity, Identity).**
